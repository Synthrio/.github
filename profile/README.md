## Hey, welcome to the SYNTHR Github ðŸ‘‹

We are building an **omnichain synthetic asset protocol**, powered by **LayerZero**, that provides users access to frictionless interoperability and slippage-free multichain liquidity. SYNTHR provides users with guaranteed and instant finality across ecosystems using a trustless method of valid delivery facilitated by an independent oracle and relayer, thus making our cross-chain communication infrastructure as secure as an oracle in a base case and even more secure in an optimistic case.

### How does SYNTHR benefit users?
1. Users can swap into any asset on any chain with zero slippage, using the internal DEX, SYNTHSWAP.
2. Users can mint synthetic assets (by staking collateral such as ETH, USDC, and USDT upto 150%) and add liquidity on partner DEXs - 70% of protocol fees is given to LP providers.
2. Users can create cross-chain CDPs - collateral on one chain and mint CDP on second chain.
3. Users can trade cross-chain futures, options, and perpetuals - collateral on one chain and trade on second chain.

### How does SYNTHR benefit ecosystems such as L1s and L2s?
1. TVL - through users staking collateral for minting synthetic assets and adding liquidity on partner DEXs.
2. Transactions - by enabling users to perform slippage-free swaps and trading of futures, options, and perpetuals.
3. Users - allowing users from other ecosystems to seamlessly swap into assets within the ecosystem.
4. Interoperability - by giving users access to multichain liquidity without the risk of bridging.

Weâ€™ve been building since **February 19th, 2021** and we don't plan on stopping anytime soon. That's when we made our first commit. Since then we have pushed **over 20k commits**, opened **over 300 issues**, submitted roughly **80 pull requests** across **4 repositories**.

### Building an interconnected community

The open source community is at the heart of SYNTHR and fundamental to how we build our protocol. If you are interested in helping us, reach out to us at nitin@synthr.io.
