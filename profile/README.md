## Hey, this is us 👋

Yes, we are building GitHub on GitHub. In fact, we’ve been doing this since **October 19th, 2007**. That's when we made our first commit. Since then we pushed **over 2.5 million commits**, opened **over 1 million issues**, submitted roughly **650k pull requests** across **4357 repositories** from over **50 countries** 🤯. But that's just us. We are proud  to be part of the work of millions of developers, companies and robots across the solar system 🪐. Yes, [Robots](https://github.com/readme/featured/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter)!

### 🍿 An interconnected community

The open source community is the 💗 heart of GitHub and fundamental to how we build software today. See for yourself:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) helped support more than **5k** individuals and projects around the world 🌍
- Open source projects on GitHub received a stunning **218 million** contributions 🚀 in the last year alone
- **Every minute** a developer creates a new release 🏄 for a public project on GitHub

Now that we are talking about the important things ☝️, are you contributing to open source? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Open source software is made by people just like you. Learn more about [how to contribute](https://opensource.guide/).

### 🦦 Contributing to the ecosystem

We contribute to the tools 🔧 we rely on to build and run GitHub, while also maintaining 🧙‍♂️ our own open source projects like:

- [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) - A command line tool for GitHub
- [Git Large File Storage](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs) - A git extension for versioning large files
- [Primer](https://github.com/primer/css) - The GitHub design system
