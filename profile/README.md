## Hey, this is us 👋

Yes, we are building a decentralzed protocol to enable traders to trade synthetic assets in a safe, capital efficient and a trustless manner. Death spiral resitant :face_with_spiral_eyes: and peg protected :magnet: :chart:. 

We’ve been building since **February 19th, 2021** and we dont plan on stopping anytime soon. That's when we made our first commit. Since then we pushed **over 20k commits**, opened **over 300 issues**, submitted roughly **80 pull requests** across **4 repositories** 🤯. Track the work on our [Internal Development Tracker Board](https://app.databox.com/datawall/893bef32e42ef48956c58eb5ab1156770628df6d2)!

### 🍿 Building an interconnected community

The open source community is at the 💗 heart of Synthr and fundamental to how we build our protocol. If you are interested in helping us(you rock🎸), reach out to us at nitin@synthr.io.
